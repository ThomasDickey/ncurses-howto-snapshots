Now that you have seen the capabilities of ncurses and its sister libraries, you
are rolling your sleeves up and gearing for a project that heavily manipulates
screen. But wait..  It can be pretty difficult to write and maintain complex GUI
widgets in plain ncurses or even with the additional libraries. There are some
ready-to-use tools and widget libraries that can be used instead of writing your
own widgets. You can use some of them, get ideas from the code, or even extend
them.</P

CDK stands for 'Curses Development Kit' and it currently contains 21 ready
to use widgets which facilitate the speedy development of full screen
curses programs. </EM

>The kit provides some useful widgets, which can be used in your programs
directly. It's pretty well written and the documentation is very good. The
examples in the examples directory can be a good place to start for beginners.
The CDK can be downloaded from <A

>Widget Type           Quick Description
===========================================================================
Alphalist             Allows a user to select from a list of words, with
                      the ability to narrow the search list by typing in a
                      few characters of the desired word.
Buttonbox             This creates a multiple button widget. 
Calendar              Creates a little simple calendar widget.
Dialog                Prompts the user with a message, and the user
                      can pick an answer from the buttons provided.
Entry                 Allows the user to enter various types of information.
File Selector         A file selector built from Cdk base widgets. This
                      example shows how to create more complicated widgets
                      using the Cdk widget library.
Graph                 Draws a graph.
Histogram             Draws a histogram.
Item List             Creates a pop up field which allows the user to select
                      one of several choices in a small field. Very useful
                      for things like days of the week or month names.
Label                 Displays messages in a pop up box, or the label can be
                      considered part of the screen.
Marquee               Displays a message in a scrolling marquee.
Matrix                Creates a complex matrix with lots of options.
Menu                  Creates a pull-down menu interface.
Multiple Line Entry   A multiple line entry field. Very useful
                      for long fields. (like a description
                      field)
Radio List            Creates a radio button list.
Scale                 Creates a numeric scale. Used for allowing a user to
                      pick a numeric value and restrict them to a range of 
                      values.
Scrolling List        Creates a scrolling list/menu list.
Scrolling Window      Creates a scrolling log file viewer. Can add 
                      information into the window while its running. 
                      A good widget for displaying the progress of
                      something. (akin to a console window)
Selection List        Creates a multiple option selection list.
Slider                Akin to the scale widget, this widget provides a
                      visual slide bar to represent the numeric value.
Template              Creates a entry field with character sensitive 
                      positions. Used for pre-formatted fields like
                      dates and phone numbers.
Viewer                This is a file/information viewer. Very useful
                      when you need to display loads of information.

an <A

>Linux is based on the Unix operating system, but also features a number of
unique and useful kernel features and application programs that often go beyond
what is available under Unix. One little-known gem is "dialog", a utility for
creating professional-looking dialog boxes from within shell scripts. This
article presents a tutorial introduction to the dialog utility, and shows
examples of how and where it can be used</EM
></P
><P
> 
As he explains, dialog is a real gem in making professional-looking dialog boxes
with ease. It creates a variety of dialog boxes, menus, check lists etc.. It is
usually installed by default. If not, you can find it at <A

TARGET="_top"
> ibiblio
linux archive</A
>. </P
><P
>The above-mentioned article gives a very good overview of its uses and
capabilites.  The man page has more details. It can be used in variety of
situations. One good example is building of linux kernel in text mode. Linux
kernel uses a modified version of dialog tailored for its needs. </P
><P
>dialog was initially designed to be used with shell scripts. If you want to use
its functionality in a c program, then you can use libdialog. The documentation
regarding this is sparse. Definitive reference is the dialog.h header file which
comes with the library. You may need to hack here and there to get the required
output. The source is easily customizable. I have used it on a number of
occasions by modifying the code.</P

Once installed you can use these modules from perl scripts like any other
module. For more information on perl modules see perlmod man page. The above
modules come with good documentaion and they have some demo scripts to test the
functionality. Though the widgets provided are very rudimentary, these modules
provide good access to curses library from perl.</P

For more information see man pages Curses(3) , Curses::Form(3) and
Curses::Widgets(3).  These pages are installed only when the above modules are
aquired and installed.</P
