    Widget Libraries</a></h1>

    <p>Now that you have seen the capabilities of ncurses and its
    sister libraries, you are rolling your sleeves up and gearing
    for a project that heavily manipulates screen. But wait.. It
    can be pretty difficult to write and maintain complex GUI
    widgets in plain ncurses or even with the additional libraries.
    There are some ready-to-use tools and widget libraries that can
    be used instead of writing your own widgets. You can use some
    of them, get ideas from the code, or even extend them.</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="CDK" id="CDK">19.1. CDK (Curses
      Development Kit)</a></h2>

      <p>In the author's words</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">CDK stands for
      'Curses Development Kit' and it currently contains 21 ready
      to use widgets which facilitate the speedy development of
      full screen curses programs.</i></span>
      </p>

      <p>The kit provides some useful widgets, which can be used in
      your programs directly. It is pretty well written and the
      documentation is very good. The examples in the examples
      directory can be a good place to start for beginners. The CDK
      can be downloaded from <a href=
      "https://invisible-island.net/cdk/" target=
      "_top">https://invisible-island.net/cdk/</a> . Follow the
      instructions in README file to install it.</p>

        "WIDGETLIST">19.1.1. Widget List</a></h3>

        <p>The following is the list of widgets provided with cdk
        and their description.</p>

        <pre class=
        "PROGRAMLISTING">Widget Type           Quick Description
===========================================================================
Alphalist             Allows a user to select from a list of words, with
                      the ability to narrow the search list by typing in a
                      few characters of the desired word.
Buttonbox             This creates a multiple button widget. 
Calendar              Creates a little simple calendar widget.
Dialog                Prompts the user with a message, and the user
                      can pick an answer from the buttons provided.
Entry                 Allows the user to enter various types of information.
File Selector         A file selector built from Cdk base widgets. This
                      example shows how to create more complicated widgets
                      using the Cdk widget library.
Graph                 Draws a graph.
Histogram             Draws a histogram.
Item List             Creates a pop up field which allows the user to select
                      one of several choices in a small field. Very useful
                      for things like days of the week or month names.
Label                 Displays messages in a pop up box, or the label can be
                      considered part of the screen.
Marquee               Displays a message in a scrolling marquee.
Matrix                Creates a complex matrix with lots of options.
Menu                  Creates a pull-down menu interface.
Multiple Line Entry   A multiple line entry field. Very useful
                      for long fields. (like a description
                      field)
Radio List            Creates a radio button list.
Scale                 Creates a numeric scale. Used for allowing a user to
                      pick a numeric value and restrict them to a range of 
                      values.
Scrolling List        Creates a scrolling list/menu list.
Scrolling Window      Creates a scrolling log file viewer. Can add 
                      information into the window while its running. 
                      A good widget for displaying the progress of
                      something. (akin to a console window)
Selection List        Creates a multiple option selection list.
Slider                Akin to the scale widget, this widget provides a
                      visual slide bar to represent the numeric value.
Template              Creates a entry field with character sensitive 
                      positions. Used for pre-formatted fields like
                      dates and phone numbers.
Viewer                This is a file/information viewer. Very useful
                      when you need to display loads of information.

        <p>A few of the widgets are modified by Thomas Dickey in
        recent versions.</p>

        "CDKATTRACT">19.1.2. Some Attractive Features</a></h3>

        <p>Apart from making our life easier with readily usable
        widgets, cdk solves one frustrating problem with printing
        multi colored strings, justified strings elegantly. Special
        formatting tags can be embedded in the strings which are
        passed to CDK functions. For Example</p>

        <p>If the string</p>

        <pre class=
        "PROGRAMLISTING">"&lt;/B/1&gt;This line should have a yellow foreground and a blue
background.&lt;!1&gt;"</pre>
        <p>given as a parameter to newCDKLabel(), it prints the
        line with yellow foreground and blue background. There are
        other tags available for justifying string, embedding
        special drawing characters, etc. Please refer to the man
        page cdk_display(3X) for details. The man page explains the
        usage with nice examples.</p>

        <p>All in all, CDK is a well-written package of widgets,
        which if used properly can form a strong frame work for
        developing complex GUI.</p>

      dialog</a></h2>

      <p>Long long ago, in September 1994, when few people knew
      linux, Jeff Tranter wrote an <a href=
      "http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue5/2807.html"
      target="_top">article</a> on dialog in Linux Journal. He
      starts the article with these words..</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Linux is based
      on the Unix operating system, but also features a number of
      unique and useful kernel features and application programs
      that often go beyond what is available under Unix. One
      little-known gem is "dialog", a utility for creating
      professional-looking dialog boxes from within shell scripts.
      This article presents a tutorial introduction to the dialog
      utility, and shows examples of how and where it can be
      used</i></span>
      </p>

      <p>As he explains, dialog is a real gem in making
      professional-looking dialog boxes with ease. It creates a
      variety of dialog boxes, menus, check lists, etc. It is
      usually installed by default. If not, you can download it
      from <a href="https://invisible-island.net/dialog/" target=
      "_top">Thomas Dickey</a>'s site.</p>

      <p>The above-mentioned article gives a very good overview of
      its uses and capabilities. The man page has more details. It
      can be used in variety of situations. One good example is
      building of linux kernel in text mode. Linux kernel uses a
      modified version of dialog tailored for its needs.</p>

      <p>dialog was initially designed to be used with shell
      scripts. If you want to use its functionality in a c program,
      then you can use libdialog. The documentation regarding this
      is sparse. Definitive reference is the dialog.h header file
      which comes with the library. You may need to hack here and
      there to get the required output. The source is easily
      customizable. I have used it on a number of occasions by
      modifying the code.</p>

      Perl Curses Modules CURSES::FORM and CURSES::WIDGETS</a></h2>

      <p>The perl module Curses, Curses::Form and Curses::Widgets
      give access to curses from perl. If you have curses and basic
      perl is installed, you can get these modules from <a href=
      "http://www.cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html" target=
      "_top">CPAN All Modules page</a>. Get the three zipped
      modules in the Curses category. Once installed you can use
      these modules from perl scripts like any other module. For
      more information on perl modules see perlmod man page. The
      above modules come with good documentation and they have some
      demo scripts to test the functionality. Though the widgets
      provided are very rudimentary, these modules provide good
      access to curses library from perl.</p>

      <p>Some of my code examples are converted to perl by Anuradha
      Ratnaweera and they are available in the <tt class=
      "LITERAL">perl</tt> directory.</p>

      <p>For more information see man pages Curses(3) ,
      Curses::Form(3) and Curses::Widgets(3). These pages are
      installed only when the above modules are acquired and
      installed.</p>
