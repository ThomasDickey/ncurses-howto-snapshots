      Introduction</a></h1>

      <p>In the olden days of teletype terminals, terminals were
      away from computers and were connected to them through serial
      cables. The terminals could be configured by sending a series
      of bytes. All the capabilities (such as moving the cursor to
      a new location, erasing part of the screen, scrolling the
      screen, changing modes etc.) of terminals could be accessed
      through these series of bytes. These control seeuqnces are
      usually called escape sequences, because they start with an
      escape(0x1B) character. Even today, with proper emulation, we
      can send escape sequences to the emulator and achieve the
      same effect on a terminal window.</p>

      <p>Suppose you wanted to print a line in color. Try typing
      this on your console.</p>
      <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
echo "^[[0;31;40mIn Color"
</pre>

      <p>The first character is an escape character, which looks
      like two characters ^ and [. To be able to print it, you have
      to press CTRL+V and then the ESC key. All the others are
      normal printable characters. You should be able to see the
      string "In Color" in red. It stays that way and to revert
      back to the original mode type this.</p>
      <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
echo "^[[0;37;40m"
</pre>

      <p>Now, what do these magic characters mean? Difficult to
      comprehend? They might even be different for different
      terminals. So the designers of UNIX invented a mechanism
      named <tt class="LITERAL">termcap</tt>. It is a file that
      lists all the capabilities of a particular terminal, along
      with the escape sequences needed to achieve a particular
      effect. In the later years, this was replaced by <tt class=
      "LITERAL">terminfo</tt>. Without delving too much into
      details, this mechanism allows application programs to query
      the terminfo database and obtain the control characters to be
      sent to a terminal or terminal emulator.</p>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="WHATIS" id="WHATIS">1.1. What is
        NCURSES?</a></h2>

        <p>You might be wondering, what the import of all this
        technical gibberish is. In the above scenario, every
        application program is supposed to query the terminfo and
        perform the necessary stuff (sending control characters
        etc.). It soon became difficult to manage this complexity
        and this gave birth to 'CURSES'. Curses is a pun on the
        name "cursor optimization". The Curses library forms a
        wrapper over working with raw terminal codes, and provides
        highly flexible and efficient API (Application Programming
        Interface). It provides functions to move the cursor,
        create windows, produce colors, play with mouse etc. The
        application programs need not worry about the underlying
        terminal capabilities.</p>

        <p>So what is NCURSES? NCURSES is a clone of the original
        System V Release 4.0 (SVr4) curses. It is a freely
        distributable library, fully compatible with older version
        of curses. In short, it is a library of functions that
        manages an application's display on character-cell
        terminals. In the remainder of the document, the terms
        curses and ncurses are used interchangeably.</p>

        <p>A detailed history of NCURSES can be found in the NEWS
        file from the source distribution. The current package is
        maintained by <a href="mailto:dickey@his.com" target=
        "_top">Thomas Dickey</a>. You can contact the maintainers
        at <a href="mailto:bug-ncurses@gnu.org" target=
        "_top">bug-ncurses@gnu.org</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="WHATCANWEDO" id=
        "WHATCANWEDO">1.2. What we can do with NCURSES</a></h2>

        <p>NCURSES not only creates a wrapper over terminal
        capabilities, but also gives a robust framework to create
        nice looking UI (User Interface)s in text mode. It provides
        functions to create windows etc. Its sister libraries
        panel, menu and form provide an extension to the basic
        curses library. These libraries usually come along with
        curses. One can create applications that contain multiple
        windows, menus, panels and forms. Windows can be managed
        independently, can provide 'scrollability' and even can be
        hidden.</p>

        <p>Menus provide the user with an easy command selection
        option. Forms allow the creation of easy-to-use data entry
        and display windows. Panels extend the capabilities of
        ncurses to deal with overlapping and stacked windows.</p>

        <p>These are just some of the basic things we can do with
        ncurses. As we move along, We will see all the capabilities
        of these libraries.</p>

        "WHERETOGETIT">1.3. Where to get it</a></h2>

        <p>All right, now that you know what you can do with
        ncurses, you must be rearing to get started. NCURSES is
        usually shipped with your installation. In case you don't
        have the library or want to compile it on your own, read
        on.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Compiling the
        package</i></span></p>

        <p>NCURSES can be obtained from <a href=
        "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/ncurses.tar.gz" target=
        "_top">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/ncurses.tar.gz</a>
        or any of the ftp sites mentioned in <a href=
        "http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html" target=
        "_top">http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html</a>.</p>

        <p>Read the README and INSTALL files for details on to how
        to install it. It usually involves the following
        operations.</p>
        <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
    tar zxvf ncurses&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz  # unzip and untar the archive
    cd ncurses&lt;version&gt;               # cd to the directory
    ./configure                             # configure the build according to your 
                                            # environment
    make                                    # make it
    su root                                 # become root
    make install                            # install it
</pre>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Using the
        RPM</i></span></p>

        <p>NCURSES RPM can be found and downloaded from <a href=
        "http://rpmfind.net" target="_top">http://rpmfind.net</a> .
        The RPM can be installed with the following command after
        becoming root.</p>

        Purpose/Scope of the document</a></h2>

        <p>This document is intended to be a "All in One" guide for
        programming with ncurses and its sister libraries. We
        graduate from a simple "Hello World" program to more
        complex form manipulation. No prior experience in ncurses
        is assumed. The writing is informal, but a lot of detail is
        provided for each of the examples.</p>

        <p>There is a top level Makefile included in the main
        directory. It builds all the files and puts the
        ready-to-use exes in demo/exe directory. You can also do
        selective make by going into the corresponding directory.
        Each directory contains a README file explaining the
        purpose of each c file in the directory.</p>

        <p>For every example, I have included path name for the
        file relative to the examples directory.</p>
