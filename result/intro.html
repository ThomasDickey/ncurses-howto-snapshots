>In the olden days of teletype terminals, terminals were away from computers and
were connected to them through serial cables. The terminals could be configured
by sending a series of bytes to each of them. All the capabilities (such as 
moving the cursor to a new location, erasing part of the screen, scrolling the 
screen, changing modes, changing appearance, colors, brightness, blinking, 
underlining, reverse video etc.) of terminals could be accessed through these 
series of bytes which are usually called escape sequences because they start 
with an escape(0x1B) character. Even today, with proper emulation, we can send 
escape sequences to the emulator and achieve the same effect on the terminal 
window.</P

>The first character is an escape character, which looks like two characters ^ 
and [. To be able to print that you have to press CTRL+V and then the ESC key. 
All the others are normal printable characters. You should be able to see the 
string "In Color" in red. It stays that way and to revert back to the original 
mode type this.</P

>Now, what do those magic characters mean? Difficult to comprehend? They might
even be different for different terminals. So the designers of UNIX invented a 
mechanism named <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>termcap</TT
>. It is a file that
lists all the capabilities of a particular terminal, along with the escape
sequences needed to achieve a particular effect. In the later years, this was 
replaced by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
> terminfo</TT
>. Without delving too 
much into details, the concept of the mechanism is to allow application 
programs query the terminfo database and obtain the control characters to be 
sent to the terminal or terminal emulator.</P

NAME="WHATIS"
>1.1. What is NCURSES?</A
></H2
><P
> 
You might be wondering, what the import of all this technical gibberish is.  In
the above scenario, every application program is supposed to query the terminfo
and do the necessary stuff(sending control characters etc.).  It soon became
difficult to manage this complexity and this gave birth to 'CURSES'.  Curses is
a pun on the name "cursor optimization". The Curses library forms a wrapper
over working with raw terminal codes, and provides highly flexible and
efficient API (Application Programming Interface). It provides functions to
move the cursor, create windows, produce colors, play with mouse etc.  The
Application programs need not worry about the underlying terminal capabilities.</P
><P
>So what is NCURSES? NCURSES is a clone of the original System V Release 4.0
(SVr4) curses. It is a freely distributable library, fully compatible with
older version of curses.  In short, it is a library of functions that manages
an application's display on character-cell terminals.  In the remainder of the
document, the terms curses and ncurses are used interchangeably.  </P

>1.2. What we can do with NCURSES</A
></H2
><P
>Ncurses not only creates a wrapper over terminal capabilities, but also gives a
robust framework to create nice looking UI (User Interface)s in text mode.  It
provides functions to create windows etc.  Its sister libraries panel, menu and
form provide an extension to the basic curses library. These libraries usually
come along with curses. One can create applications that contain multiple
windows, menus, panels and forms. Windows can be managed independently, can
provide 'scrollability' and even can be hidden.</P
><P
> 
Menus provide the user with an easy command selection option.  Forms allow the
creation of easy-to-use data entry and display windows.  Panels extend the
capabilities of ncurses to deal with overlapping and stacked windows.</P
><P
>These are just some of the basic things we can do with ncurses. As we move
along, We will see all the capabilities of these libraries. </P
