    World !!!</a></h1>

    <p>Welcome to the world of curses. Before we plunge into the
    library and look into its various features, let's write a
    simple program and say hello to the world.</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="COMPILECURSES" id=
      "COMPILECURSES">2.1. Compiling With the NCURSES
      Library</a></h2>

      <p>To use ncurses library functions, you have to include
      ncurses.h in your programs. To link the program with ncurses
      the flag -lncurses should be added.</p>
      <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
    #include &lt;ncurses.h&gt;
    .
    .
    .

    compile and link: gcc &lt;program file&gt; -lncurses
</pre>

      <div class="EXAMPLE">
        <a name="BHW" id="BHW"></a>

        <p><b>Example 1. The Hello World !!! Program</b></p>
        <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<span class="INLINEMEDIAOBJECT">#include &lt;ncurses.h&gt;

int main()
{       
        initscr();                      /* Start curses mode              */
        printw("Hello World !!!");      /* Print Hello World              */
        refresh();                      /* Print it on to the real screen */
        getch();                        /* Wait for user input */
        endwin();                       /* End curses mode                */

        return 0;
}</span>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="DISSECTION" id="DISSECTION">2.2.
      Dissection</a></h2>

      <p>The above program prints "Hello World !!!" to the screen
      and exits. This program shows how to initialize curses and do
      screen manipulation and end curses mode. Let's dissect it
      line by line.</p>

      <div class="SECT3">
        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="ABOUT-INITSCR" id=
        "ABOUT-INITSCR">2.2.1. About initscr()</a></h3>

        <p>The function initscr() initializes the terminal in
        curses mode. In some implementations, it clears the screen
        and presents a blank screen. To do any screen manipulation
        using curses package this has to be called first. This
        function initializes the curses system and allocates memory
        for our present window (called <tt class=
        "LITERAL">stdscr</tt>) and some other data-structures.
        Under extreme cases this function might fail due to
        insufficient memory to allocate memory for curses library's
        data structures.</p>

        <p>After this is done, we can do a variety of
        initializations to customize our curses settings. These
        details will be explained <a href="init.html">later</a>
        .</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT3">
        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="MYST-REFRESH" id=
        "MYST-REFRESH">2.2.2. The mysterious refresh()</a></h3>

        <p>The next line printw prints the string "Hello World !!!"
        on to the screen. This function is analogous to normal
        printf in all respects except that it prints the data on a
        window called stdscr at the current (y,x) co-ordinates.
        Since our present co-ordinates are at 0,0 the string is
        printed at the left hand corner of the window.</p>

        <p>This brings us to that mysterious refresh(). Well, when
        we called printw the data is actually written to an
        imaginary window, which is not updated on the screen yet.
        The job of printw is to update a few flags and data
        structures and write the data to a buffer corresponding to
        stdscr. In order to show it on the screen, we need to call
        refresh() and tell the curses system to dump the contents
        on the screen.</p>

        <p>The philosophy behind all this is to allow the
        programmer to do multiple updates on the imaginary screen
        or windows and do a refresh once all his screen update is
        done. refresh() checks the window and updates only the
        portion which has been changed. This improves performance
        and offers greater flexibility too. But, it is sometimes
        frustrating to beginners. A common mistake committed by
        beginners is to forget to call refresh() after they did
        some update through printw() class of functions. I still
        forget to add it sometimes :-)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT3">
        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="ABOUT-ENDWIN" id=
        "ABOUT-ENDWIN">2.2.3. About endwin()</a></h3>

        <p>And finally don't forget to end the curses mode.
        Otherwise your terminal might behave strangely after the
        program quits. endwin() frees the memory taken by curses
        sub-system and its data structures and puts the terminal in
        normal mode. This function must be called after you are
        done with the curses mode.</p>
