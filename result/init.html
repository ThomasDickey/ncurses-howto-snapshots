  <div class="SECT1">
    <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="INIT" id="INIT">4.
    Initialization</a></h1>

    <p>We now know that to initialize curses system the function
    initscr() has to be called. There are functions which can be
    called after this initialization to customize our curses
    session. We may ask the curses system to set the terminal in
    raw mode or initialize color or initialize the mouse etc..
    Let's discuss some of the functions that are normally called
    immediately after initscr();</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="ABOUTINIT" id="ABOUTINIT">4.1.
      Initialization functions</a></h2>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="RAWCBREAK" id="RAWCBREAK">4.2.
      raw() and cbreak()</a></h2>

      <p>Normally the terminal driver buffers the characters a user
      types until a new line or carriage return is encountered. But
      most programs require that the characters be available as
      soon as the user types them. The above two functions are used
      to disable line buffering. The difference between these two
      functions is in the way control characters like suspend
      (CTRL-Z), interrupt and quit (CTRL-C) are passed to the
      program. In the raw() mode these characters are directly
      passed to the program without generating a signal. In the
      <tt class="LITERAL">cbreak()</tt> mode these control
      characters are interpreted as any other character by the
      terminal driver. I personally prefer to use raw() as I can
      exercise greater control over what the user does.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="ECHONOECHO" id="ECHONOECHO">4.3.
      echo() and noecho()</a></h2>

      <p>These functions control the echoing of characters typed by
      the user to the terminal. <tt class="LITERAL">noecho()</tt>
      switches off echoing. The reason you might want to do this is
      to gain more control over echoing or to suppress unnecessary
      echoing while taking input from the user through the getch()
      etc. functions. Most of the interactive programs call
      <tt class="LITERAL">noecho()</tt> at initialization and do
      the echoing of characters in a controlled manner. It gives
      the programmer the flexibility of echoing characters at any
      place in the window without updating current (y,x)
      co-ordinates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="KEYPAD" id="KEYPAD">4.4.
      keypad()</a></h2>

      <p>This is my favorite initialization function. It enables
      the reading of function keys like F1, F2, arrow keys etc.
      Almost every interactive program enables this, as arrow keys
      are a major part of any User Interface. Do <tt class=
      "LITERAL">keypad(stdscr, TRUE)</tt> to enable this feature
      for the regular screen (stdscr). You will learn more about
      key management in later sections of this document.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="HALFDELAY" id="HALFDELAY">4.5.
      halfdelay()</a></h2>

      <p>This function, though not used very often, is a useful one
      at times. halfdelay()is called to enable the half-delay mode,
      which is similar to the cbreak() mode in that characters
      typed are immediately available to program. However, it waits
      for 'X' tenths of a second for input and then returns ERR, if
      no input is available. 'X' is the timeout value passed to the
      function halfdelay(). This function is useful when you want
      to ask the user for input, and if he doesn't respond with in
      certain time, we can do some thing else. One possible example
      is a timeout at the password prompt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="MISCINIT" id="MISCINIT">4.6.
      Miscellaneous Initialization functions</a></h2>

      <p>There are few more functions which are called at
      initialization to customize curses behavior. They are not
      used as extensively as those mentioned above. Some of them
      are explained where appropriate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="INITEX" id="INITEX">4.7. An
      Example</a></h2>

      <p>Let's write a program which will clarify the usage of
      these functions.</p>

      <div class="EXAMPLE">
        <a name="BINFU" id="BINFU"></a>

{       int ch;

        initscr();                      /* Start curses mode            */
        raw();                          /* Line buffering disabled      */

                printw("%c", ch);
                attroff(A_BOLD);
        }
        refresh();                      /* Print it on to the real screen */
        getch();                        /* Wait for user input */
        endwin();                       /* End curses mode                */

      <p>This program is self-explanatory. But I used functions
      which aren't explained yet. The function <tt class=
      "LITERAL">getch()</tt> is used to get a character from user.
      It is equivalent to normal <tt class="LITERAL">getchar()</tt>
      except that we can disable the line buffering to avoid
      &lt;enter&gt; after input. Look for more about <tt class=
      "LITERAL">getch()</tt>and reading keys in the <a href=
      "keys.html">key management section</a> . The functions attron
      and attroff are used to switch some attributes on and off
      respectively. In the example I used them to print the
      character in bold. These functions are explained in detail
      later.</p>
